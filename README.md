# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction - Regression 

## Problem Statement

As urbanization surges and sustainability takes center stage, bike-sharing systems have become a staple in cities worldwide. However, a persistent challenge remains: the inconsistency in bike availability across stations often leads to customer dissatisfaction due to long waiting times. To address this issue effectively, our project endeavors to develop a machine learning model. This model aims to accurately forecast the demand for bike rentals by leveraging various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week. By doing so, we aim to empower bike-sharing companies to optimize their inventory management, ensuring a sufficient number of bikes are readily accessible at high-demand locations and times. Ultimately, our efforts seek to not only enhance customer satisfaction but also streamline revenue generation by providing a stable and reliable supply of rental bikes.


## Project Summary 

Bike soul is a bike sharing service in the city of Seoul, South Korea. It is part of the city's efforts to promote sustainable transportation and reduce traffic congestion. The service allows residents and visitors to rent bicycles at various stations across the city and return them to any other station, providing a convenient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. In recent years, the demand for bike rentals in Seoul has increased, leading to the need for a more efficient and effective way to manage the bike sharing operations. Accurately predicting bike demand is crucial for optimizing fleet management, ensuring the availability of bikes at high-demand locations, and reducing waste and costs.
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the demand for bike rentals in Seoul, South Korea, based on historical data and various relevant factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and public holidays.

Firstly, I began by acquiring and preprocessing the dataset. The dataset contained information about bike rentals, including features such as the number of bikes rented, weather conditions, and time-related variables. I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for modeling.
Next, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different variables. This helped me identify important features that could influence bike rental demand, such as temperature, humidity, and seasonality.After completing the EDA, I split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models. I used four different algorithms for regression: linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression. Each algorithm was trained on the training dataset and evaluated using the testing dataset.To improve the performance of the models, I conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. This technique allowed me to systematically search for the best hyperparameters for each algorithm, optimizing their performance and enhancing the accuracy of the predictions.

Finally, I evaluated the performance of the models using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared value. These metrics provided insights into the models' ability to accurately predict bike rental demand. In conclusion, my machine learning project on bike sharing demand prediction involved following a systematic approach to machine learning, including data preprocessing, EDA, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. By using four different algorithms and optimizing their hyperparameters, I was able to develop a robust model for predicting bike rental demand, which could be valuable for bike sharing companies in optimizing their inventory and meeting customer demand.  


## Conclusion

The bike sharing demand prediction project involved developing a machine learning model to forecast the number of bike rentals based on various factors. The project followed a systematic approach to machine learning, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

Four different regression algorithms were considered for the prediction task: linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression. After evaluating these models, the gradient boosting regression algorithm was selected as the final prediction model due to its superior performance after hyperparameter tuning.

Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search Cross Validation (GridSearchCV) was conducted to optimize the hyperparameters of the gradient boosting regressor. This resulted in a significant improvement in the model's performance, with the mean squared error (MSE) decreasing from 13.75 to 12.79 , and the R-squared score increasing from 0.87 to 0.91.

The final model can be used by bike-sharing companies to predict demand and optimize inventory management, leading to improved customer satisfaction and increased revenue. Overall, the project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting bike sharing demand and its potential impact on business operations.
